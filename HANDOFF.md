# Handoff Notes â€“ Vibe-Aware Music Flow

## What Changed
- Vibe stats from the browser are preserved end-to-end; the interpreter clamps invalid readings instead of rebuilding synthetic defaults.
- `/api/generate-vibe-music` now generates a creative brief (`style`, tempo target, six vibe axes, vocals policy, instrumentation hints) and forwards it alongside the weather snapshot. Vocals are hard-locked to `off` so every track is instrumental.
- `elevenlabs_agentos.py` consumes the brief directly, builds the prompt from those axes, and emits a structured `fallback` plan when ElevenLabs cannot return audio (the frontend keeps the vibe via a local playlist).
- Shared TypeScript + Pydantic models capture the expanded brief, context lock timestamps, and fallback contract for both sides of the bridge.
- The vibe page tracks a style-lock (â‰¥60â€¯s) and applies the fallback playlist automatically when the backend requests it.

## How to Demo
1. `npm run dev` â†’ open http://localhost:3000/vibe.
2. Start the vibe check; grant camera + mic access.
3. Trigger a vibe capture; inspect the network call to `/api/generate-vibe-music` â€” you should see `stats`, `decision`, `weather`, `promptMetadata`, and `brief` in the payload.
4. Watch the AgentOS logs (`python elevenlabs_agentos.py`) â€” the creative brief JSON is logged (source `frontend` vs `reconstructed`) and any fallback activation emits a `ðŸŽ¼ Using local playlist fallbackâ€¦` line.
5. Force a failure by pulling the network cable (or using the mock key): the UI keeps playing a labelled fallback track (still instrumental-only) and the lock timer prevents thrash.

## Testing Snapshot
- `npx eslint app/api/generate-vibe-music/route.ts app/vibe/page.tsx lib/vibe` (passes with existing `adaptivePlayer.current` cleanup warning)
- `python3 -m compileall elevenlabs_agentos.py` (syntax check)

## Follow-Ups
- Consider persisting a cache of locally pre-rendered tracks per style so fallback playback does not rely on remote CC-licensed URLs.
- Capture a few real-world vibe sessions and audit the generated creative brief for tone/length; tune `musicBrief.ts` coefficients as necessary.
- If Spotify control is required for vibe-based adjustments, pipe the decision/action + fallback reason into the playback layer (currently stored but unused).
